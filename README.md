Divmod Vertex
=============

Divmod Vertex is the first implementation of the Q2Q protocol, which is a peer-to-peer communication protocol for establishing stream-based communication between named endpoints.

It is also a P2P application client and server platform in the early stages of development.
It is currently quite usable for knocking holes in firewalls, but requires some polish to really be usable.
