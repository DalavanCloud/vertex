Vertex
=============

Vertex is the first implementation of the Q2Q protocol, which is a
peer-to-peer communication protocol for establishing stream-based 
communication between named endpoints.

It is also a P2P application client and server platform in the early stages of
development.  It is currently quite usable for knocking holes in firewalls, 
but requires some polish to really be usable.

History
-------

Vertex was originally written by developers at Divmod.  Vertex, together
with other components, comprised the
[Divmod.org project](https://code.launchpad.net/divmod.org/).

Future Plans
------------
Not sure yet, but tentative plans are to support only Twisted >= 13.1 (when
it is released) and Python >= 2.7.
